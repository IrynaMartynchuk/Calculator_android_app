My solution includes basic functions of calculator: -, +, x, /; added backspace button and AC button to clear the screen.
Also, I added possibility to count percentage. I thought that it will improve usability if user
can calculate multiple operations at a time and see intermediate result, something like “2+10x200/34-10%”.
Regarding UI I made color coding, you can see that all operator buttons have green(mint) color, equals
button has red color and all number and decimal buttons have grey color. Many apps have light and dark mode,
I personally prefer Dracula/dark mode in all apps and programs that I use, that’s why I decided to
implement dark mode in calculator app.
I tried to test all possible variations to detect bugs in app. For running app, I used virtual device Nexus 5X API 28. As an IDE I used Android Studio 3.3.1.
