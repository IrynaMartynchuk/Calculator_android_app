As it was written in assignment description my solution includes basic functions of
calculator: -, +, x, /; added backspace button and AC button to clear the screen.
Also, I added possibility to count percentage. I thought that it will improve usability if user
can calculate multiple operations at a time and see intermediate result, something like “2+10x200/34-10%”.
Regarding UI I made color coding, you can see that all operator buttons have green(mint) color, equals
button has red color and all number and decimal buttons have grey color. Many apps have light and dark mode,
I personally prefer Dracula/dark mode in all apps and programs that I use, that’s why I decided to
implement dark mode in calculator app.
I feel proud that I implemented multiple operations functionality, and added percentage calculation,
I tried to test all possible variations to detect bugs in app. In my code I have a lot of if else
conditions, probably there is a possibility to implement same solution with less amount, but I came
to this solution, since I am not familiar with all specific aspects of android. I am also not sure
about the amount of comments, if I had to explain almost every line of code. I explained main steps
and methods.
 If I had more time, I could implement more functions for calculator. Also, there is one thing I
 am not sure how to do now, when you switch from light theme to dark one, the activity is restarted
 and if something was typed in screen view, it disappears. I read that there is a possibility to
 switch without restarting the activity, so if I had more time, I could dig into this aspect also.
 For running app, I used virtual device Nexus 5X API 28. As an IDE I used Android Studio 3.3.1.
